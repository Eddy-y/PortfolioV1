        In 2023, I had the chance to enroll in Googleâ€™s Data Analytics certification course. During this course, I learned several practices 
        and workflows on the matter of data analytics. In order to complete said certification, a final project was required. With this purpose

      In the proposed scenario for Bellabeat's analysis, I was a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a 
      manufacturer of high-tech products focused on women's health. I was asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart 
      device data to understand how consumers use their smart devices and present my recommendations based on the analysis.
