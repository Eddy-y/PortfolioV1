      One of the projects for which I feel the most proud is the RAG application developed to provide 
      precise responses to specific problems. This project was created as a means to dive into the use of
      Large Language Models and Vector Databases. This project was meant to serve as an introduction for the
      integration of AI into the workspace and any industry specific workflow.
    </p>

      It is important to mention that this project was only used as the Proof-Of-Concept for what would
      eventually be integrated into real industry projects. Regardless, I consider this project to have 
      challenged me to learn foreign concepts to me at that time. Some of the problems this app aimed to 
      solve where hallucinations and obsolete data, both big issues that consistently showed on AI models 
      at that time.

      This application proved once again the strenght of AIs and how they are capable of optimizing 
      processes and accelerating timelines in the workspace, as long as they are used correctly and 
      within the right context.
