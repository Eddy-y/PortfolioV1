      One of the projects I am most proud of is a RAG application developed to provide precise responses 
      to specific problems. This project was a way for me to dive into using Large Language Models and 
      Vector Databases. It was designed to serve as an introduction for integrating AI into the workplace 
      and industry-specific workflows.
    </p>

      It's important to mention that this project was only used as a Proof of Concept for what would 
      eventually be integrated into real industry projects. Regardless, I consider this project to have 
      challenged me to learn concepts that were foreign to me at the time. Some of the problems this app 
      aimed to solve were hallucinations and obsolete data, both of which were big issues consistently 
      seen in AI models at the time.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      This application proved once again the strength of AI and how it can optimize processes and 
      accelerate timelines in the workplace, as long as it's used correctly and within the right context.
