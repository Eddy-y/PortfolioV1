      The application features a clean, user-friendly front-end developed with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. We integrated several libraries 
      to enhance the user experience and simplify interactions. On the back-end, we utilized Java to build a robust and functional system based

      data model to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.
