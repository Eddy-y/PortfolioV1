## 🚀 Technologies Used

This portfolio is a modern web application built with a powerful tech stack.

* **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for optimal performance.

## 📁 Project Structure

The codebase is organized for clarity and easy customization.

* `src/components/`: Reusable React components for the website's UI.
* `src/data/`: All content for the website, including projects, skills, and personal information, is stored here. This makes it easy to update the site without touching the code.
